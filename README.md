# ML_Model_On_Insurance_DataSet
This project is my first machine learning model, built using the Insurance dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict medical insurance charges based on customer information such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. This project helped me understand the end-to-end ML workflow.
